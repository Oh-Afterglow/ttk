**移动平台这课太顶了！一个小作业的要求赶上一个大作业，一个大作业的要求赶上创业！**

**（窗户，手，白纸）快逃！快逃！快逃！**

This is the source code of the 4th assignment of ZJU course \`Mobile Platform Development\`. The requirement is to develop an application with any theme using swiftUI + ARKit + \<SceneKit \| RealityKit\>. This project selects SceneKit to implement a physical effect.

Although there's a storyboard file, this project uses SwiftUI. Xcode doesn't provide a project template for SceneKit + ARKit on swiftUI, and I modified the template for UIKit to achieve this, but the storyboard is needed to run the project.

This piece of code is a result of lack of time, or the UI and models might get optimized. 

The 'object' model is produced using a new technology released in WWDC 2021 ([Create 3D models with Object Capture](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10076/)).
